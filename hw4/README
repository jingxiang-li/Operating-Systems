==========================
Overview
==========================
- This is a "twitterTrend" program written in C that will concurrently process clients' requests for the top 3 trending keywords in different cities.

==========================
Compiling and Running
==========================
- To compile it, use: "make all", then executable file "twitterTrend" can be found in the current working directory
- To run the program, use "./twitterTrend input_file_path num_threads"
- To remove everything other than source files, use: "make clean"

==========================
Implementation
==========================
- This program will first read two databases, "twitter_db" for top 3 keywords in different cities, "client_db" for informations about clients waiting to be processed.
- Then the program will create a shared queue, and then concurrently process clients' requests. The program will push client's request into the queue, and pop request from the queue one at a time and process the request in a concurrent and controlled way.
- The program applies POSIX semaphore as synchronization mechanism to manage the access to the shared queue.
